Each piece of content has an **icon** (any `Texture2D`) and an **icon tint** to recolor it.
Monsters and the player also have `frames` (their SpriteFrames in `data/visuals/`): a new monster
can reuse an existing one, or you can make a new SpriteFrames from a sheet in `assets/characters/`.
Floor looks (tiles, decor, tint, darkness, music) are `DungeonTheme` files in `data/dungeon/themes/`, one per biome.
How many lanterns, prop clusters, hazard groups and chests a floor gets, how often ambushes and
elites happen, is in `dungeon_config.tres`.

`min_depth` and `spawn_weight` control where and how often something appears.
A `spawn_weight` of 0 means it never spawns on its own (starting gear, loot-only items, monster weapons).
