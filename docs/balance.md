### 2026-10-20 - Phase 1: rules and themes (no simulator yet)

Everything here was done by reading the code and the data; nothing was measured on the arena yet
(tools/balance is being built). Phase 2 measures and tunes the numbers below.

#### Sustain rules changed (code, unit and game tests)

The owner could beat a boss by standing still with Vampirism or a life-drain rune. Causes found:
lifesteal rounded every hit up (`roundi`: 8% of a 7-damage hit healed 1, i.e. 14%; every bolt of
the Arcane ring healed 1), on-kill heals fed on a boss's summoned adds, and nothing limited
stacking (three Leech runes, Vampirism, the Blood family and the Fury rune all added up).

| Rule | Before | After | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ticks and secondary hits | lifesteal only skipped them because `Actor.take_hit` drops the attacker of secondary hits; Ice Shards' shards and the Arcane ring of bolts were direct hits (lifesteal, chain counters, Kindling...) | `LifestealPassive` ignores `is_tick` / `is_secondary` itself; shots fired by passives are secondary (`ProjectileSpec.secondary`, `ProjectileEffect.secondary`, set on the Arcane ring and on kill-burst shards) and get no extra projectiles from Multishot / Prism | lifesteal_passive.gd, projectile.gd, kill_burst_passive.gd, world.gd |
| Rounding | `roundi` per hit (and `maxi(1, ...)` per kill for the Blood family) | fractions add up per actor (`SustainMeter.pending`), paid in whole points; nothing banked at full health | src/combat/sustain_meter.gd |
| Shared limit | none | one budget for every heal from hits, kills and skills (Leech, Vampirism, Devotion, the Blood family, Fury, Vampiric gear): holds **20%** of max Health, refills **4% of max Health per second** | data/dungeon/sustain.tres (`SustainRules`, `DungeonConfig.sustain`) |
| Boss fights | same as anywhere | the budget refills at **x0.5** (2% of max Health per second) while `World.is_boss_fight()` | `SustainRules.boss_fight_rate` |
| Summons and adds | on-kill heals counted every kill | summoned monsters (`Monster.summoned`) and, during a boss fight, every non-boss kill feed no on-kill heal (`Actor.can_heal_killer()`); Fortune drops nothing from summons either (their own loot was already off) | monster.gd, heal_on_kill / bloodlust / loot_on_kill passives |

Monsters keep whole-point accumulation but no budget (a Vampiric elite heals as before).
Potions, springs, healing spells (Smite, Holy Light, Holy Shield), the Easy difficulty's heal on a
new floor and the level-up full heal are not limited: they are deliberate, scarce or between
fights.

What it means for a 100-Health hero: up to 20 Health at once (a pack of 3 slain together with
Vampirism 3 still heals fully), then 4 per second; 2 per second against a boss. One Leech rune on
a katana (9 damage, 2.6 hits a second = 2.3 Health a second) is never cut against packs; against
a boss with 5 Armor (about 5 damage a hit, 1.3 a second) it is under the boss-fight limit too.
Three Leech runes, or Leech + Vampirism + Blood, hit the limit and stop there.

Leech: 8% -> **10%** (exact now instead of rounded up: at act I damage the old 8% healed 12-14%
per hit, so 10% keeps the pack fantasy). Description: "Your hits heal 10% of the damage they deal
(burns and side effects don't)."

Guard tests: unit `_test_sustain` (fractions, full health, the burst, the rate, the boss-fight
rate, a minute of stacked sustain stays under the limit, a single Leech rune is never cut);
game `_test_sustain_in_game` (a burn tick and a secondary hit heal nothing, 6 small hits heal
floor(total x 10%), a shard fired by a perk heals nothing, three Leech runes on 40-damage hits
every frame for a second heal no more than the budget, a summoned rat's death heals nothing, an
ordinary one does); boss `_test_boss_fight` (adds, summoned or not, heal nothing; the boss does).

#### Families: what moved and why

Fantasies (pillar 4): Inferno = fire, burning; Frost = cold, slows, freezing; Blood = health, life
drain, low-health power; Storm = lightning, chains, speed of the strike; Arcane = skills, spells,
cooldowns. Plain-number perks belong to no family.

Before (common perks | relics):

| Family | Perks | Misfits |
|---|---|---|
| Inferno | Ignite, Frenzy, Kindling, Blazing Roll \| War Banner, Phoenix Feather | Frenzy (pure attack speed), War Banner (damage, crit, attack speed) |
| Frost | Frostbite, Cold Snap, Ice Shards \| Guardian Ring | only 3 common perks; Guardian Ring a plain ward |
| Blood | Vampirism, Strength, Vitality, Thorns \| Executioner | Strength (pure damage), Thorns (nothing about blood) |
| Storm | Precision, Thunderclap, Shock Roll, Swiftness \| Multishot | Precision (crits, nothing electric), Multishot (extra projectiles) |
| Arcane | Arcane Focus, Arcane Power, Devotion, Echo \| Sage's Codex, Multishot | - |
| none | Fortune, Iron Skin | |

After:

| Family | Common perks | Relics | Members |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inferno | Ignite, Kindling, Blazing Roll, **Burning Thorns** | Phoenix Feather | 5 |
| Frost | Frostbite, Cold Snap, Ice Shards, **Frost Armor** | Guardian Ring | 5 |
| Blood | Vampirism, Vitality, **Bloodrage** (new), **Devotion** | Executioner | 5 |
| Storm | **Frenzy**, Thunderclap, Shock Roll, Swiftness | - | 4 |
| Arcane | Arcane Focus, Arcane Power, Devotion, Echo | Sage's Codex, Multishot | 6 |
| none | **Strength**, **Precision**, Fortune | **War Banner** | |

- **Frenzy** Inferno -> Storm: attack speed is the speed of the strike; its icon (flying kunai)
  already said so. Color changed to Storm's.
- **War Banner** Inferno -> none: damage, crit and attack speed are plain numbers.
- **Multishot** Storm + Arcane -> Arcane: more projectiles (fireballs included) is a spell thing,
  nothing electric about it.
- **Precision** Storm -> none: crit chance and an opening crit are plain numbers.
- **Strength** Blood -> none: +damage is not blood.
- **Thorns** Blood -> Inferno, light rework **Burning Thorns**: enemies that hit you up close take
  4 damage per level *and catch fire* (2 every 0.5 s for 3 s). `ThornsPassive.status` (optional).
  Same id, same icon (orange spikes), Inferno's color. The "of Thorns" affix and Spiked elites
  are unchanged.
- **Iron Skin** none -> Frost, light rework **Frost Armor**: +1 Armor per level, and getting hit
  releases a wave of cold that throws enemies back *and slows them 40%* (once every 3 s).
  `RetaliatePassive.status` (optional). Same id, same icon (an icy shield), Frost's color.
- **Devotion** Arcane -> Arcane + Blood: healing with every skill is both.
- **Bloodrage** (new Blood common, icon recolored from Strength's): below half Health, +15% damage
  per level (max 3). `BloodlustPassive` bonus is now per level (the family and the Fury rune have
  1 level: unchanged).
- **Guardian Ring** stays Frost: "Every floor starts with a shell of frost that soaks up 20
  damage" (the ward already breaks in icy sparkles).

Every family has 4 common perks; sizes 4-6 with relics. Guard test: unit `_test_family_themes`
(4+ common perks each, sizes within 2, the moves above, plain-number perks familyless, no
HP/ATK/DEF in perk, family or rune texts).

Runes (all kept in their family):

| Rune | Family | Effect | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ember | Inferno | hits 35% chance to burn | fits |
| Pyre | Inferno | burning deaths burst into flames | fits |
| Rime | Frost | hits slow 20% | fits |
| Shatter | Frost | crits release a shockwave | **was a plain shockwave**: now it also slows 40% for 1.5 s (`CritShockwavePassive.status`) |
| Leech | Blood | hits heal 10% of their damage | was 8% rounded up per hit |
| Fury | Blood | below half +30% damage, kills heal 2% | fits |
| Spark | Storm | every 4th hit chains to 2 | fits |
| Gale | Storm | the roll throws a gust | wind of a storm: fits |
| Echo | Arcane | skills 12% ready again | fits |
| Prism | Arcane | +1 projectile | fits; strength to measure (below) |

Plain words: "HP" replaced by "Health" in Vampirism, Devotion, Executioner, Phoenix Feather, the
Blood family, the Fury rune and the Vampiric affix.

#### Static sanity pass

Fixed (clear-cut):
- **Strength** max level 5 -> 3 (+10 -> +6 damage). It was the only damage perk with 5 levels,
  and flat damage is worth double against flat Armor (`Combat.mitigate`): at max, a katana at
  level 6 (10 power) against a boss with 5 Armor went from 5 to 15 damage a hit (x3), against
  +48% for Frenzy or +60% for Arcane Power at max. Now x2.2 there, +60% raw.

Listed for phase 2 (need measuring, not clear-cut from reading):
- **Multishot** (max 2: three shots) and **Prism** (stackable, 3 sockets on an Epic) on
  single-shot weapons (Bow, Spark Wand, Fireball): up to x3-x4 damage if the fan hits; depends on
  range and spread (12 degrees per projectile).
- **Ignite** max 3: a flat 6 every 0.5 s (12 a second per target, AoE weapons spread it) is huge
  in act I (a slime has 26 Health) and fades later (Armor eats ticks, no depth scaling).
- **Vitality** max 5: +75 Health when the hero starts at 60.
- **Executioner** +120% at max under 35% Health.
- **Echo** perk 45% at max + Echo runes (each rolls on its own) + of Echoes: cooldown loops.
- **Frost Armor** max 4: +4 Armor makes many weak hits deal 1 (`Combat.mitigate` minimum).
- **Swiftness** +75% for 1.5 s after a roll at max, with roll-on-cooldown builds.

#### Open questions for phase 2 (to measure with the arena)

1. Face-tank vs kite for each boss with: no sustain, one Leech rune, three Leech runes,
   Vampirism 3 + Blood awake + Fury. Must the face-tank lose with every one? Is
   `boss_fight_rate` 0.5 needed, enough, or too harsh (try 1.0 / 0.5 / 0.25)?
2. Packs: healing by source per minute with the same builds: does `burst` 20% / `rate` 4% leave
   Leech and Vampirism feeling good (most kills fully paid)? Target: a single sustain source is
   never capped on packs.
3. Family strength side by side (time to clear a pack room, boss time) for the five awake
   families: the Arcane ring is now secondary (no Frost/Kindling bonus, no lifesteal, no extra
   projectiles from Multishot/Prism) - check Arcane didn't fall behind; Storm has no relic.
4. Strength (now 3 levels) against Frenzy, Arcane Power, Kindling at max, on fast (Rapier, Sai)
   and slow (War Hammer) weapons, against Armor 0 and 5.
5. Multishot / Prism on Bow, Spark Wand, Fireball: damage per second at 64, 128, 256 px.
6. Ignite and Ember at act I vs act IV (flat burns against depth scaling and Armor).
7. Bloodrage + Blood + Fury below half Health (+115%): with sustain limited, is staying low a
   real risk/reward or a trap?
8. Vampiric elites and Vampiric bosses (60% lifesteal, monsters have no budget): fight length.
9. Burning Thorns and Frost Armor against swarms (Swarm floors) and act IV damage.
10. The level-up full heal: can a fight be turned by XP mid-boss? (summons give none; adds that
   are not summoned do: check BossDef summons all set `summoned`.)
